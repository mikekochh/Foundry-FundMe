Project Description:

This project goes over many of the fundamental features of Foundry as well as touching heavily upon testing Solidity smart contracts that were written in previous lessons in the Youtube series. The tests involved are simply unit tests to cover
as much code as possible in our application. We also extensively go through scripts and learn how to use them properly and how powerful of a tool they can be. This was an excellent lessson from Patrick, highly recommend his work if you're new to the
space.
